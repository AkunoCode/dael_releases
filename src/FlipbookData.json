Enverga University Foundation’s 76th year centered around transcending excellence. Now, entering our 77th year, we are venturing beyond borders– a journey of excellence towards fostering ASEAN harmony. In honoring our founder’s legacy, we haven’t simply relied on past achievements. Instead, we have continued to make significant progress, experiencing growth, and achieving global competitiveness across all facets. This milestone not only marks an accomplishment for our institution but also stands as evidence of the collaborative efforts of every student, employee, faculty, and stakeholder. As students, we hold a crucial role in commemorating this achievement. Beyond being mere learners, we serve as ambassadors for the greater good and the advancement of our institution. Let us seize this opportunity to contribute to the enduring legacy of excellence as we progress forward.",
